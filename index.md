# Hi, I'm George

I develop deep learning systems for automated birdsong analysis, focusing on self-supervised approaches that eliminate the need for manual annotation. My research centers on building models that generate rich embeddings capturing the inherent structure and patterns in avian vocalizations. These embeddings enable automated parsing and classification of song syllables, advancing our ability to analyze birdsong at scale. 

Seeking Summer 2025 internship in ML/DL research or engineering.
