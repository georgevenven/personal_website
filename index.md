# Hi, I'm George

I develop deep learning systems for automated birdsong analysis, focusing on self-supervised approaches that eliminate the need for manual annotation. My research centers on building models that generate rich embeddings capturing the inherent structure and patterns in avian vocalizations. These embeddings enable automated parsing and classification of song syllables, advancing our ability to analyze birdsong at scale. My work combines innovative applications of representation learning with bioacoustics, creating systems that can autonomously discover and characterize vocal elements in natural bird recordings. Seeking Summer 2025 internship opportunities in ML/DL research or engineering to further explore applications of self-supervised learning.
