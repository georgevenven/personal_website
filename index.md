# Hi, I'm George

My core research interest lies in constructing and understanding machine intelligence. For my PhD, I am specializing in self-supervised deep learning systems for automated birdsong analysis. This work has accelerated neuroscience experiments and revealed the effects of brain lesions and psychedelics on birdsong production.

Hobbies: Automotive sports, snowboarding, bodybuilding, soccer, tennis, reading. 

**Seeking Summer 2025 internship in ML/DL research or engineering.**
